# UART Controller Project

## Overview

Hey there! This project is all about building a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) controller from scratch. The main idea right now is to get the basics of UART up and running, and eventually turn it into a cool Network Interface Card (NIC) using some fun modern tricks like DMA (Direct Memory Access).

## Features

- **Basic UART**: Start with basic transmit and receive functionalities.
- **Buffering**: Use circular buffers for handling data efficiently.
- **Interrupts**: Handle UART interrupts for smooth data flow.
- **Configurability**: Allow baud rate selection and parity settings.
- **Future Plans**: Incorporate DMA for faster data transfers, support for advanced networking protocols.

## Evolution Plans

We're aiming to transform this UART controller into a full-fledged NIC with:

- **DMA**: Implement DMA controllers for lightning-fast data transfers.
- **Multi-Layer Networking Abilities**: Support Ethernet, TCP/IP, UDP, and more protocols.
- **Interrupts**: Improve interrupt handling to keep data flowing smoothly.
- **Performance Boost**: Use hardware acceleration to speed up data processing.
